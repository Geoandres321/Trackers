# Trackers
Test:

Given a set of 3 tracker tables equally spaced at a given row spacing, determine the optimal tracking angle for each tracker table to avoid self-shading. So back tracking that accounts for elevation differences.
Assumptions:

Rotation Limit +/- 60 degrees
Maximum slope between adjacent tracker tables 15%

Variable inputs will be (assume all measurements are in either feet or degrees):

Row Spacing
Module Length
Height of tracker axis of rotation (you can assume center of panel passes through rotational axis for simplicity) for each tracker table
Sun elevation angle (for simplicity assume angle can be from 10-90 degrees)
Only consider morning hours (sun coming from the east)
 

Desired Ouput:

Tracker Angle for each table
