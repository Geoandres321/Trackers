# Solar Tracker Optimization

## Introduction

This repository contains a Python script that performs solar tracker optimization for a photovoltaic (PV) system. The main goal of this project is to find optimal tracker angles that minimize shadowing and maximize solar exposure, thus enhancing the overall efficiency of the PV system.

## Installation

To run the script, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies using the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run
Navigate to the cloned repository and run the script using:

bash
Copy code
python solar_tracker_optimization.py
Architecture
The script is designed to calculate solar angles, optimize tracker angles, and visualize the results. It leverages the pvlib library for solar position calculations and scipy for optimization.

Project Layout
The repository is organized as follows:

solar_tracker_optimization.py: The main Python script for solar tracker optimization.
requirements.txt: List of required Python packages.
README.md: Project documentation.
Results
The script generates optimized tracker angles over a specified time range and visualizes them alongside solar angles. This visualization provides insights into the performance of the optimized tracker angles.

Built With
pvlib - A library for solar energy modeling.
scipy - A scientific library for optimization.
Version
This is version 1.0 of the Solar Tracker Optimization script.
